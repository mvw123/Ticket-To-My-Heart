TICKET TO MY HEART
==================

A bit of fun for your loved one. 

This is a small PCB in the shape of a cinema ticket inscribed with the words “Ticket to my heart” and “Admit One”. 
It is intended to be produced with black solder mask on a ENIG (Gold) PCB with milling all around the edges. 

Produced with eagle 7.5

CAD A - [WORK IN PROGRESS]
===========================
 
CAD A3 
* Corrected text positions and changed rear panel text to Golden Ticket
* Removed the web address on the rear to give it a cleaner look, though possibly losing some love and appreciation:)
* PCBs.io board visualiser gives a very good render of the PCB 
* The PCB was around USD$5 to produce.  
* Sent to PCBs.io for manufacture 9 Nov 2017
* Would benefit from text outline change on the straight lines. see ticket raised for this issue

CAD A2 
* Removed the small board outline which allows the PCBs.io software to visualise the board correctly.
* CAD A2 sent to PCBs.io 9 Nov 2017
* board thickness 1.6mm
* Named: Ticket to my heart admit one

CAD A 
* Had a small board outline randomly placed near the origin. This hasn’t affected elecrow, though may affect PCBs.io
* CAD A sent to Elecrow for manufacture 9 Nov 2017. - Boards returned 23 Nov 2017 and they look great! Of the 10 boards a few have slight imperfections in the solder mask, the corners are not rounded as they should have been. Though checking the gerber shows that they are rounded in the gerber. 
* CAD A also sent it to PCBs.io to test their process because its cheaper, see notes below.
* Visually confirmed at OSH park using the board visualisation system. Unfortunately they only have purple solder mask and this project requires black solder mask. 
* Used Elecrow DRC and 2 layer CAM files to produce gerbers.
* Black solder mask (not matt black)
* 1.00mm board
* ENIG
* 2 layer
* FR4
* PCB smaller than 50mmx50mm

Note: The cost at elecrow for this was around $21. Mainly due to ENIG. The 1.00mm boards were at no extra cost. PCBs.io do this by default. PCBs.io would be cheaper though boards would be 1.6mm thick instead of the 1.0mm i used at elecrow. Though if others buy the PCB at pcbs.io i would obtain a discount on future PCBs.
