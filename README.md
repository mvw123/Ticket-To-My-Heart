TICKET TO MY HEART
==================

A bit of fun for your loved one. 
This is a small PCB in the shape of a cinema ticket inscribed with the words “Ticket to my heart” and “Admit One”. 

It is intended to be produced with black solder mask on a ENIG (Gold) PCB with milling all around the edges


CAD A - [WIP]
===========================
CAD A had a small board outline randomly placed near the origin. 
CAD A2 removed the small board outline which allows the PCBs.io software to visualise the board correctly. 
 
Visually confirmed at OSH park using the board visualisation system. 
Unfortunately they only have purple solder mask and this project requires black solder mask. 

CAD A2 sent to PCBs.io 9 Nov 2017
* board thickness 1.6mm
* Named: Ticket to my heart admit one

CAD A Sent to Elecrow for manufacture 9 Nov 2017.
* Used Elecrow DRC and 2 layer CAM files to produce gerbers.
* Black solder mask (not matt black)
* 1.00mm board
* ENIG
* 2 layer
* FR4
* PCB smaller than 50mmx50mm

The cost at elecrow for this was around $21. Mainly due to ENIG. 
PCBs.io appears to do this by default. Possibly PCBs.io would be cheaper though boards would be 1.6mm thick instead of the 1.0mm i used at elecrow. Though if others buy the PCB at pcbs.io i would obtain a discount on future PCBs.
